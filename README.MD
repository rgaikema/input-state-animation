# Input state animation


## Purpose
Create an example for animations for different states when input is saved.

*Edit 14-07-2021*
Moved away from GSAP because we decided to not implement auto save functionality, but adjust the animation for in form validation. That way it was sufficient to use only class toggles and CSS animations.
